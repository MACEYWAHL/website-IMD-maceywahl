    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> My name is Macey Wahl and I am a junior at the University of Nebraska- Lincoln. I am studying Advertising and Public Relations. I love creating art and new designs. I love painting my nails and hanging with my friends and my pet bunny.</p>
    <h3>Classes This Semester</h3>
    <p>I am taking an Interactive Media Design class, a Media Ethics class, a geology class, and a criminology class.</p>
    <h4>Outside of Class</h4>
    <p>Outside of class, I paint my nails and hang with my friends. I work as a server at Zipline Tap & Grill and spend most of my time there with my great coworkers.</p>
    <h5>After Graduation</h5>
    <p> After I graduate, I would love the opportunity to travel to beautiful places and volunteer and help others. I am looking for a position in a company where I can be on a creative team making advertisements or working with public relations and different communities. </p>
