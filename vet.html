            <img src="images/bunny/milo_hayfeet.jpg" class="problempics">
            <p>This is a condition that occurs when a rabbit's diet does not have enough fiber. If not treated, this condition can be fatal for rabbits. Thankfully, feeding lots of hay (high in fiber) to your bunny is an effective preventive. Introducing too many new foods into a rabbit's diet can also cause GI Stasis in rabbits; if you want your bunny to try new things, do it one food at a time. You will know if your bunny has GI Stasis when they get bloated, sluggish, loses appetite, stops drinking fluids, and stops pooping.</p>

            <img src="images/bunny/bunnyteeth.jpg" class="problempics">
            <p>Rabbit teeth grow continuously, so they need to chew on toys to wear them down. Chewing high-fiber foods, like hay, on a regular basis keeps teeth at a functional length. If your rabbit is chewing on something they shouldn't be, don't punish them as this is a natural and healthy behavior. Bunny-proofing your home is the answer to redirect this natural behavior to chew toys.</p>
