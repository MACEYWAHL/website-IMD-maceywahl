        <h1>Cleaning for Healthy Bunnies</h1>
            <p> Bunnies need clean and safe environment to thrive and be happy in. Daily cleaning should occur as well as weekly deep cleans of spaces where your rabbit frequents. Litter boxes will by far be the most dirty space and will need the most attention.</p>

                    <h2 class="cleancard-title"> Litter Box</h2>
                    <img src="images/bunny/litter.jpg" alt="cleanpic">
                    <p>Bunnies can be easily litter box trained (similar to a cat). The box needs to be cleaned out every other day with a mixture of vinegar and water. Materials for the litter box could be aspen shavings, compressed pellets, or cotton bedding.</p>
                    <p> Diluted vinegar solution is the safest and cheapest option for a cleaning solution. It is also very cheap to make. Take white/cleaning vingear and do half vingear and half water in a spray bottle.</p>

                    <img src="images/bunny/vaccum.jpg" alt="cleanpic">  
                    <p> Bunnies have a lot of hair and make quite the mess with hay. Vacuuming will help keep the ground where your bunny lives clean and looking fresh. This also helps eliminate dust and other foreign objects (potentially dangerous for rabbits) from the ground. Do this everyday.</p>

                    <img src="images/bunny/water.jpg" alt="cleanpic">
                    <p> Bunnies drink lots of water. They need clean and fresh water avaliable 24/7. They should also be drinking from water bowls and not bottles. Bottles are an unnatural way for your rabbit to drink water and can lead to dehydration.</p>

        <h1>Grooming for Healthy Bunnies</h1>
                    
               <p>Bunnies have lots of thick and soft hair. Unlike cats, bunnies can't cough up hairballs after grooming themselves. This is where the owner comes in. You must brush your bunny regularly as bunnies go through many shedding seasons a year. Not grooming a bunny and letting them do all the work can lead to digestive tract problems and can also lead to hair matting which is uncomfortable. You can tell by the look of the coat and the shape and uniformity of their poops to tell whether or not your bunny needs more help with their coat. </p>

                            <p>Good grooming brushes come in all shapes and sizes and depending on the breed of bunny, coats will be different as there are long and short-haired coats. Before buying a grooming brush, do some research on your bunny breed and what is best for them!</p>

                            <p>Another very important thing is nail trims. Bunnies nails, similar to cats and dogs, continuously grow. The bunny can wear down it's nails on their own, but checking up on your bunnies nails and trimming them when they get too long is essential to health.</p>

                            <p>Bunnies are fragile animals and can hurt their spine and legs easily if handled incorectly. Make sure your rabbit is secure in your arms before lifting and never put them on their back unless absolutely necessay.</p>
