<h1>Breakdown of a Bunnies Diet</h1>
    <p>Every bunny breed is slightly different on the amount of food they are supposed to eat everyday, but many guidelines are based on bunny weight. The food types given however will be the same.</p>

            <h2 class="dietcard-title"> Pellets</h2>
            <img src="images/bunny/pellets.jpg" alt="Timothy-Based Pellets">
            <p>Good timothy hay pellets should be a regular part of an adult rabbit's diet. High levels of fiber are found in timothy hay-based pellets, which rabbits need for better digestion. Feed no pellets containing corn, nuts, or seeds.</p>

            <h2 class="dietcard-title"> Hay</h2>
            <img src="images/bunny/hay.jpg" alt="Timothy Hay">
            <p>For rabbits to have good digestive tract mobility, they need to eat enough fiber. Timothy hay offers the satisfying nutritional benefits of protein along with a high fiber content. Timothy hay has shown to be an effective supporter of oral health due to the high fiber content in the stems. Rabbit teeth never stop growing over their lifetime so chewing is essential to health.</p>

            <h2 class="dietcard-title"> Fresh Vegetables</h2>
            <img src="images/bunny/vegetables.jpg" alt="Fresh Vegetables">
            <p>Vegetables should be given to your rabbit daily. Rabbits prefer green leafy items, although they can also consume herbs, root vegetables, and  even small amounts of fruit. The majority of vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, green leaf lettuce, bok choy,Â green peppers, and squash, are safe for rabbits.</p>

    <h3> There are many foods that are toxic to bunnies. It is essential to do your research before giving your rabbit any food. Some fruits and vegetables will also be toxic, so don't assume your rabbit can have any fresh fruits or vegetables.  </h3>
    <section class="col-span-4">
         <div class="card">
            <h2 class="badfood-title"> Toxic Fruits and Veggies</h2>
            <p> Fruits to AVOID: Avocados, Apricots, Plums, Peaches (many fruit seeds and skins are toxic to rabbits) </p>
            <p> Vegetables to AVOID: Iceberg Lettuce, Garlic, Turnips, Leeks, Mushrooms, Peas, Rhubarb, Onions, Shallots</p>
           </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2 class="badfood-title"> No Processed Foods</h2>
            <p> Excessive carbohydrates are hard for rabbits to digest and should be avoided. Foods like corn, walnuts, rice, and bread, oats, and beans should not be given. A good rule of thumb is no human food for rabbits unless it is a safe vegetable or fruit.</p>
    </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2 class="badfood-title"> Give in Moderation</h2>
            <p> Those sugary fruits your rabbit loves should only be give 1-2 times a week and in very small amounts. High sugar and high carbohydrate foods are hard to digest and can cause an array of health problems. Many vegetables should only be given in moderation as well (most vegetables that are safe for rabbits, can be given to them daily). </p>
