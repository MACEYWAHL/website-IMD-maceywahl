        <p>I am taking an Interactive Media Design class, a Media Ethics class, a geology class, and a criminology class.</p>
     <h3>Outside of Class</h3>
        <p>Outside of class, I paint my nails and hang with my friends. I work as a server at Zipline Tap & Grill and spend most of my time there with my great coworkers.</p>
     <h3>After Graduation</h3>
        <p> After I graduate, I would love the opportunity to travel to beautiful places and volunteer and help others. I am looking for a position in a company where I can be on a creative team making advertisements or working with public relations and different communities. </p>
